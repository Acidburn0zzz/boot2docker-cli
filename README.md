# go-boot2docker

This is the Go port of the boot2docker
(https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker) management script. It is intended
to replace the shell version because the shell script cannot be used on Windows
without cygwin. 

The Go port will produce a single binary without extra dependencies.
